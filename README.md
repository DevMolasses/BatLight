This repository is a place for the collection of all items that are needed for the construction of a Batman Logo
light for my son's room.  In here you will find the following:

In order to use to use the included sketches, you will need to download the DevMolasses_NeoPixel Library.
This library is an extension of the Adafruit_NeoPixel Library.
